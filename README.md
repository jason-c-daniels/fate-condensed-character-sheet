# Fate Condensed Character Sheet

## About
This is a quick and dirty character sheet implementation for the Fate Condensed (TM) SRD table top roleplaying game.
You can save (download) your character sheet and load (upload, sort of, no server needed) as well as print your character.
The file format is a relatively straightforward JSON file, should you be curious, or have need to edit it outside of the editor.

You can [try it out here](https://jason-c-daniels.github.io/fate-condensed-character-sheet/)
