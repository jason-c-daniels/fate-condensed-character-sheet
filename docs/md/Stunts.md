# Stunts
While every character has access to all the skills—even if they are Mediocre (+0) at most of them—your character has some unique stunts. Stunts are the cool techniques, tricks, or bits of equipment that make your character unique and interesting. Where skills are about a character’s broad competencies, stunts are about specific areas of excellence; most of them give you a bonus in particular circumstances or let you do something that other characters simply can’t.

Your character begins with three free stunt slots. You don’t have to define them all right away, and may fill them in as you play. You may purchase more stunts by spending 1 refresh each, to a minimum of 1 refresh.

## Writing Stunts
You write your own stunts when building a character. Broadly, there are two types of stunts.

__Bonus-granting stunts__: The first type of stunt gives you a +2 bonus when you use a named skill within certain parameters, usually limited to a specific type of action (page XX) and type of narrative circumstance.

Write this type of stunt as follows:

_Because I __[describe how you are amazing or have a cool bit of gear]__, I get a +2 when I use __[pick a skill]__ to __[pick one: overcome, create an advantage, attack, defend]__ when __[describe a circumstance]__._

__Example Bonus-Granting Stunt__: Because I am a __military-trained sniper__, I get a +2 when I use __Shoot__ to __attack__ when __I have a target In My Sights__.

__Rule-changing stunts__: The second type of stunt __changes the rules of the game__. This is a broad category that includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- __Swapping which skills are used in a given situation__. For instance, a researcher might use Academics to perform a ritual, while anyone else would use Lore.
- __Using an action with a skill that isn’t normally used with it__. For instance, allowing a character to use Stealth to backstab an opponent from the shadows (which would typically be a use of Fight).
- __Giving a character a different kind of bonus to skills that’s roughly equivalent to a +2__. For instance, when a skilled orator creates an advantage with Rapport, it gets an extra free invoke.
- __Allowing a character to declare a minor fact is always true__. For instance, a survivalist always has survival items like matches on their person, even under unlikely circumstances. This type of stunt establishes that you do not need to invoke for story details (page XX) for the given fact.
- __Allowing a character to make a specific rules exception__. For instance, a character might have two more stress boxes or another mild consequence slot.

Write this type of stunt as follows:

_Because I __[describe how you are amazing or have a cool bit of gear]__, I can __[describe your amazing feat]__, but only __[describe a circumstance or limitation]__._

__Example Rule-Changing Stunt__: Because I don’t believe in magic, I can ignore the effects of a supernatural ability, but only once per game session.
