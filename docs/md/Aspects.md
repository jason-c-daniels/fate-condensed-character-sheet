# Aspects

Aspects are short phrases that describe who your character is or what is important to them. They can relate to your character’s physical or mental qualities, history, beliefs, training, relationships, or even particularly important equipment.

The first thing to know about them is: Aspects are true (see page XX for a discussion of this). In other words, how you define your character is real and true in the story you’re telling. If you write down that your character is a Precog Sniper, then they are a precog sniper. You’ve told everyone that your character sees the future and is a crack shot with a rifle.

You’ll also use aspects in play to change the story. They give you permission to improve your dice rolls and establish facts about the world. Lastly, aspects can earn you fate points if they create complications for your character—so to make the most versatile aspects, you should aim for ones that are double-edged, working both for you and against you.

To learn more about aspects and what makes a good one, consider reading some of Aspects and Fate Points (page XX).

To begin, you’ll give your character five aspects: a high concept, a trouble, a relationship, and two free aspects. 
Start with the high concept and go from there.

## High Concept

Your high concept is a broad description of the character, covering the vital bits. It’s how you would open your pitch 
for the character when telling a friend about them.

## Trouble

Next is your character’s trouble—something that makes your character’s life more complicated. It could be a personal 
weakness, family entanglements, or other obligations. Pick something you’ll enjoy roleplaying!

## Relationship

Your relationship describes a connection with another PC. They may already know one another, or have just met.

Good relationship aspects should introduce or hint at conflict, or at least an imbalance that gives the relationship a 
little momentum. This doesn’t mean they are openly antagonistic, but they shouldn’t be all roses either.

If you wish, you can wait to write down relationship aspects until everyone has more or less completed their characters.

## Free Aspects

You can make your character’s last two aspects anything you want—there are no restrictions beyond the obligation to fit 
the setting. Choose anything which you think will make your character more interesting, more fun to play, or better 
connected to the world they occupy.
